## What is this plugin?

The plugins available on the market annoyed us so we decided to write our own plugin. It has the / remember command that remembers logging for 48 hours, securing multi-accounts per 1 IP address, a special pin system to increase account security and much more.

### Features

- Security of passwords and pins
- An additional function that is not required for players with the /pin command
- Fast and easy to set up
- The function of remembering login for 48 hours after entering /remember
- Completly customizable
- IP protection for multi-accounts
